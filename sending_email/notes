TLS/SSL are methods to encrypt messages
Encryption is when a device sends a message, and the message is scrambled. 
The only way to understand the message is through a key, which only the receiver device knows. 
This key is changed and deleted everytime, and so is the scrambleness of the message
The password for my email is not working :(


SMTP_SSL -> Send email through TLS encryption in a secure environment. 
Send message, then encrypts message, and inteprets the message again

.starttls -> Sends email with TLS encryption in a non secure environment
